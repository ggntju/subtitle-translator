00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
Hi. Welcome to the Kotlin for Java Developers course.

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.733
My name is Svetlana Isakova,

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.666
I¡¯ll be your instructor for this course.

4
00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:12.866
I'm a developer advocate at JetBrains and
the co-author of two books about Kotlin,

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.800
¡±Kotlin in Action", and "Atomic Kotlin¡±.

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:21.533
This course is for you if you're an experienced developer
who knows Java and wants to learn Kotlin.

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.866
I won¡¯t explain programming fundamentals or Java basics.

8
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:29.033
I will only highlight what is new and different.

9
00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:32.500
After this course, you'll be able to use Kotlin for your daily tasks.

10
00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:40.233
If you're a developer who learned Java many years ago
and now uses some other languages,

11
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.100
you may still decide to watch this course.

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.466
However, note that you may need to check some Java concepts
on your own in order to better understand what's going on.

13
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:55.933
This course will consist of four modules
which you can watch on your own pace.

14
00:00:55.933 --> 00:01:02.466
If you have a full-time job, you may decide to watch
each module in two weeks or more, that's fine.

15
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:08.866
If you, for instance, need to prepare to an interview,
then you may decide to watch everything in a week.

16
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.833
That's totally up to you.

17
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.433
We¡¯ll have many in-video questions.

18
00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:19.000
Note that sometimes these questions will introduce a new idea,

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.633
not just ask you about something that I¡¯ve already explained.

20
00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:31.000
In this case, even if you don't know the answer,
just make a pause, think, and you may guess.

21
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.866
And just afterwards, you will see the solution.

22
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:39.600
Each question will be followed by the explanation directly in the video.

23
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.566
We'll have many small tasks, which you can do directly in the browser.

24
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.200
Note that these tasks are ungraded.

25
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.433
You may just check yourself by ensuring
that all the output is as expected.

26
00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:59.100
Each such task will be accompanied by the solution video.

27
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.133
I¡¯d recommend to watch these videos after doing the task.

28
00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:07.733
Sometimes these videos may highlight alternative solutions,

29
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:12.100
compare different options, or introduce some new details.

30
00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:17.066
At the end of each module, we'll have one full assignment.

31
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:22.699
Note that you may read the task, implement the solution and

32
00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.699
check the solution from IntelliJ Idea directly using the EduTools plugin.

33
00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:32.833
You'll find all the necessary installation instructions
in the accompanying materials to this course.
